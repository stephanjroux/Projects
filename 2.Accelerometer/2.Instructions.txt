Basic Build:
============
- Build the board as per the Fritzing diagram in the root of the project.
- Open the code in the root folder and upload it to the Arduino.
- Check the Serial monitor to see the accelerometer output when you pick up and tilt the board.

Challenge: Bubble level (Spirit level)
======================================
Extra parts:
1) 0.9" I2C OLED Display

- Connect the OLED display to the Adruino
- Draw a bubble in the middle of the display that moves when you tilt the board (like a spirit level)
- Draw a frame and some cross hairs to see when the bubble is dead center
- Calibrate it so that the bubble moves to the edge of the screens widest part when 
  the board edge is around 1cm of the table
