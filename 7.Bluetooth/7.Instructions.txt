NOTE:  Take careful note of the LEDs orientation. The one side of the LED casing 
is flat and needs to be orientated correctly as per the diagram. The flat side
corresponds to the long pins and goes to the negative side of the power rail.

Basic Build:
============
- Build the board as per the Fritzing diagram in the root of the project.
- Open the code in the root folder and upload it to the Arduino.

Challenge:
==========
- Find and install a bluetooth serial terminal app on your phone (I used "Arduino Bluetooth Terminal" by Dinastia)
- Look at the code and figure out how to switch the LED using your phone.
--Note: Pairing code for HC-06 is 1234
