NOTES: Servos need more power than the Nano can route so make sure you connect 
extarnal power to the board as per the diagram.

Basic Build:
============
- Build the board as per the Fritzing diagram in the root of the project.
- Open the code in the root folder and upload it to the Arduino.
- Observe the servo moving as expected.

Challenge: Puzzle Maze Game
===========================
Extra parts:
1) Analog 2-axis Thumb Joystick
2) Dual Servo Puzzle Game

- Connect the analog joystick to the Nano and check it's outputs on the serial monitor
- Connect ONE of the game servos to the Nano and calibrate it to limit it's movement 
  WARNING: it can jam and break the game if both are on and are not limited.
- Connect the second servo and calibrate it.
- Use the Joystick to drive the game in the correct orientation and within limits so the ball doesnt fly off the table.
