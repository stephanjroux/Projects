NOTE:  Take careful note of the LEDs orientation. The one side of the LED casing 
is flat and needs to be orientated correctly as per the diagram. The flat side
corresponds to the long pins and goes to the negative side of the power rail.

Basic Build:
============
- Build the board as per the Fritzing diagram in the root of the project.
- Open the code in the root folder and upload it to the Arduino.
- Check the Serial monitor to see how the encoder values change.

Challenge: LED sweep based on encoder values
============================================
- Modify the code to have the LED sweep based on the encoder value. 
- Each LED represents 10 clicks
- Come up with a more exciting challenge for this project :-)
