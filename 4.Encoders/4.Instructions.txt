Basic Build:
============
- Build the board as per the Fritzing diagram in the root of the project.
- Open the code in the root folder and upload it to the Arduino.
- Check the Serial monitor to see how the encoder values change.

Challenge: LED sweep based on encoder values
============================================
Extra parts:
1) 4 x APA-106-F8 RGB "Neopixel" addressable LED's

NOTE: Check the pinout of the LEDs on Google to verify the polarity. 
- Wire up the LED's in series (out pin connected to in on the next)
- Modify the code to have the LED sweep on based on the encoder value. 
- Each LED represents 10 clicks
- Debounce the rotary encoder
