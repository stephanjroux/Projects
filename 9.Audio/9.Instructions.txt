NOTE:- Blowing on the mic is the easiest way to get a steady reading.

Basic Build:
============
- Build the board as per the Fritzing diagram in the root of the project.
- Open the code in the root folder and upload it to the Arduino.
- Check the Serial monitor to see what analog value you get when blowing on the mic.

Challenge:
==========
Extra parts:
1) Adafriuit "Bi-Color 8x8 Matrix" mounted on an "Adafruit LED Backpack" 

- Connect the LED matrix to the Arduino using I2C 
- Program a Bar Graph that "walks" from right to left accross the matrix showing the peak value of the mic.
- LED's 6 and under must be green and 7 and 8 must be red.
