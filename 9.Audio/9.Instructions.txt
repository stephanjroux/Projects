NOTE:- This mic circuit only works when you blow on it. Better mic amp circuit is being developed

Basic Build:
============
- Build the board as per the Fritzing diagram in the root of the project.
- Open the code in the root folder and upload it to the Arduino.
- Check the Serial monitor to see what analog value you get when blowing on the mic.

Challenge:
==========
Extra parts:
1) Adafruit 8x8 bicolor Matrix on LED Backpack

- Connect the LED matrix to the Arduino
- Program a "Manhattan Graph" that walks from right to left accross the matrix showing the peak value of the mic
- LED's 6 and under must be green and 7 and 8 must be red
