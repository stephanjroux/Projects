NOTE:  Take careful note of the LEDs orientation. The one side of the LED casing 
is flat and needs to be orientated correctly as per the diagram. The flat side
corresponds to the long pins and goes to the negative side of the power rail.
BUG: The ESP8266 WiFi chip is notoriously sensitive to dirty power so it sometimes 
needs to be jump started by repeatedly resetting the chip.  When you short the reset 
wire to ground it resets the chip and you'll see a quick blue flash of the TX led on the chip.  
Then when you reset the arduino you should get another few flashes of the TX as 
the chip is configured by the software. If not reset it again, untill it boots properly.  
Once up dont power it down else you'll need to do this again. You can unplug or reset 
the arduino as they dont share power.

Basic Build:
============
- Build the board as per the Fritzing diagram in the root of the project.
- Open the code in the root folder and upload it to the Arduino.
- Get the chip to boot up so that the TX light flashes a few times when you reboot the arduino

Challenge:
==========
- Use your cell phone to browse for the ESP Wifi device and connect to it.
- Check your phones settings under about and status somewhere for the IP address that you were given
- Open a browser and browse to http://x.x.x.1 (using the first 3 numbers that you got above) 
- Click on the LED1 and LED2 links and see what happens.
