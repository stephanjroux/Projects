The laser in this project can damage your eyes if you look into it so please be careful where you point it!

NOTE: The polarity of the laser diode on the Fritzing is incorrect. Use the signage on the part not the drawing.

Basic Build:
============
- Build the board as per the Fritzing diagram in the root of the project.
- Place the board and Mirror in such a way that the laser reflects off the mirror and back on to the photo resistor.
- Open the code in the root folder and upload it to the Arduino.
- Check the Serial monitor to see how the photo resistor behaves when you break the beam.

Challenge:
==========
Extra parts:
1) On-off switch
2) Active buzzer (not passive)

- Connect the buzzer to the Arduino to act as an alarm when the beam is tripped
- Wire up the on off switch so you can arm and disarm the alarm
- Set a siren to go off if the beam is broken while the alarm is activated.
